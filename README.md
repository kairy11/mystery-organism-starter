# Mysterious Organism Project via Codecademy
Simulating DNA behavior, mutations, and survivability in JavaScript.

A JavaScript simulation of a fictional organism (P. aequor) that mutates, compares DNA, and determines its likelihood of survival.

## Features

- Generates random DNA strands

- Simulates mutation

- Compares DNA similarity

- Evaluates survival likelihood

- Creates 30 surviving specimens

## Built With

- JavaScript (Node.js)

## What I Learned

- Factory functions and object creation

- Loops, conditionals, and array methods

- Randomization and probability in logic

- How to break down complex problems into smaller, testable parts
